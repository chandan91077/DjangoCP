OOPS (Object-Oriented Programming System)

OOPS is a programming approach where software is designed using classes and objects to model real-world entities.

🔹 Class & Object

Class → Blueprint for creating objects

Object → Instance of a class

Example:
class Student:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def show(self):
        print(self.name)

s1 = Student("Chandan")
s1.show()

🔹 Encapsulation

Definition: Binding data and methods together in a single unit (class).

Example:
class Account:
    def __init__(self, balance):
        self.balance = balance

    def show_balance(self):
        print(self.balance)

🔹 Abstraction

Definition: Hiding implementation details and showing only essential features.

Example:
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Vehicle(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def start(self):
        pass

class Car(Vehicle):
    def start(self):
        print("Car starts")

🔹 Inheritance

Definition: One class acquires properties and methods of another class.

Example:
class Parent:
    def show(self):
        print("Parent class")

class Child(Parent):
    pass

Child().show()

🔹 Polymorphism

Definition: Same method name, different behavior.

Example:
class Dog:
    def sound(self):
        print("Bark")

class Cat:
    def sound(self):
        print("Meow")

for a in (Dog(), Cat()):
    a.sound()

✅ One-Line Summary

OOPS uses classes and objects to structure programs using encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism for better code reusability and maintainability.
